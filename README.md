# About

The R Code provided in this repository allows to reproduce the entire data carpentry, analysis and visualization of *"Non-natives are linked to higher plant diversity across spatial scales"*.

Since GitHub does not allow large file sizes, all data read in the R scripts are available at:

## Folder structure

The script enumeration follows the analysis and figures in the main text.

1.  `00-preamble` loads all packages

2.  `01-data-carpentry` aggregates sPlot, GloNAF, and GRIIS databases, and groups plots within 32 sq. km grid cells

3.  `02-plot-selection` selects plots for analyses

4.  `03-diversity-metrics` calculates species richness and pielou's J and finally joins them to the plots selected in script 02

5.  `04-figure-etc` produces statistical analyses and figures of the main text

6.  `05-supplementary-figure` produces raw data plots for the supplementary amterial
